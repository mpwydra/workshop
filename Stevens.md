Response to Stevens:

Question 1) In the readings, the authors used a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human
populations across the globe. what is the name of this technique and describe in general terms how it works?
```Random forest with remotely sensed and ancillary data. The authors used Python version 2.6 using "ArcGIS 10.0 SP1" (Stevens et al. ). According to an image in the article, their process was as follows: step 1) aggregate at one adm level up; 2) process data at 10km buffered covariate boundary; 3) Extract covariate, vector-based data; 4) use improved sources to supplement base data; 5) rasterize vector data; 6) project and resample/aggregate other raster data; 7)create distance-to-rasters for rasterized Point, Line and Binary class-based Raster Covariates; 8) Aggregate covariates by census blocks and estimate Random Forest Model; 9) Predict Pixel per population  density with Random Forest Algorithm; 10) Project populatioon density prediction grid and redistribute census block totals weighted by predictions; 11) Aggregate per pixel population to finer adm units and compare to afri/asiapop/GRUMP/GPW ```
  
Question 2) The Random Forest model is Machine Leanring (ML). What is ML? Within the context of this study, what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenonand events?
```ML is where the computer is coded to take in data and learn from it, being able to do a preferred task based on information given to the computer. It takes perhaps big data and is able to make an intuitive prediction on how it would be used for its speecified task. A machine learning example takes data and makes a prediction. Statistical approaches take data and plot it. One is more data science-esc and the other is more closely related to computer science because it uses algorithms and code more deeply.```

Question 3) In the reading the authors used a number of geospatial covariates as their predictors in their machine learning method. What were  those geo cov and approx how big of a data set did they represent? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of the human population distributions?
```According to the article, "Gridded Population of the World (GPW) database, versions 2 and 3, and the Global Rural Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP)" were both used. They additionally used asiapop. These were all described as large area data sets, meaning they spanned a large area and contained a lot of information, meaning a large data set. The larger the data set, the bettter the approximation that the Machine learning algorithm can create. As such, the significance is that big data is immensely important for machine learning and is the only true way to get an accurate model for the prediction that a ML algorithm will make. ```

Question 4) The authors results present a remarkable improvement over previous geo descriptions at a very high res, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located actoss planet earth?
```Being able to map population density can help higher income countries (wealthy countries) know where to target humanitarian aid if there is ever a crisis, or if a country is still developing. Further, if the aid can be mapped as going mainly to a low-density area, the wealthy nation may be able to insinuate that the nation receiving the aid may be corrupted and using the aid for ulterior motives.```

Question 5) Within the context of human development in LMICs what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located actross planet earth?
```The Ivory Coast was colinized early on and had a rough beginning. It is actually names after the thing that was mainly traded there to wealthier, European countries. With an accurate mapping of population density, as I mentioned in the previous answer, wealthy nations would know where to repay their debts to help develop my developuing nation I'm focusing on.```
