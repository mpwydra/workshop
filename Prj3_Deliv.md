### Total Population of Bafing, Côte d'Ivoire: 
`As of 2019, it is between 175,000 - 200,000 people which was significantly easier to manage than Abidjan.`

### Settlements: 
``With only around 6 urban settlements, Bafing was very dense where there were settlements. Also, there were hundreds across Côte d'Ivoire so the conclusion can also be drawn that it is very underdeveloped. This conclusion is backed because there are only a few roadways throughout the region and only one links to a HCF (which happens to be the only HCF near Bafing). ``

### Density information: 
```The areas are all of varying population densities (as shown in the plot). The population is concentrated around the urban settlements (which is to be expected).```

### Roadways and HCFs: 
````While Bafing had a multitude of roadways throughout the area, there was only one HCF even remotely close to it (which was a hospital) but that technically wasn't even in the border of Bafing. In summation, residents of Bafing have very limited access to Healthcare Facilities.````
