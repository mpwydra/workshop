# Project 1 Deliverable: Côte d'Ivoire

## Matt Wydra 

In this project, I encountered numerous obstacles. I struggled to use several libraries because the
R Scirpt language occasionally tells me things that are incorrect so I spend hours on a woorkaround that is unnecessary
and, ultimately, takes me further away from the solution. I ended up trying to install several packages and
ended up breaking my program (hard to explain succinctly). After another few hours trying to debug, the problem
resolved itself somehow and I still have no idea why. My next obstacle was formatting things exactly how I wanted it. 
As I tried to make minor adjustments, I accidentally deleted the information I had saved and had to re-run the raster
cluster block of code, which was then followed up about 30 minutes later by another call to that block of code for
the second administrative subdivision for the first individual stretch goal. All in all, I enjoyed this program and 
managed to work through all the challenges I encountered.

As far as the data, itself, I found that my LMIC had as many level one administrative subdivisions (adm1) as many other people's
second-level administrative subdivision (adm2) which would explain how I was able to get away with using the entire country.
Additionally, the most populated area of Côte d'Ivoire is the capital, Abidjan, which is actully a very small part of the 
country, geographically. Aside from that, I noticed that the rest of the areas were all comprable to at least one other
area. Each adm1 had similar population density to at least one other adm1.
