Perspective Question: In the Lloyd et al. article, the authors introduce a method that uses a number of
different openly available geospatial datasets in order to produce high resolution, global gridded descriptions 
of human populations. Describe the geospatial datasets the authors are using in their methodology.
How is their method an improvement when compared to a conventional census? Are you able to describe how the 
authors use a number of different geospatial layers with their data science method in order to produce a high 
resolution, global gridded description of human population?

The authors use GIS raster, firstly, which is a matrix of cells. This is different from a vector because it creates
a grid of information. This is called "spatial resolution" (Lloyd, et al.). However, the authors also
used a vector, which is basically a one-dimensional representation of data. The main difference between matrices
and vectors is that a matrix is a vector of vectors, meaning that matries and multi-dimensional and vectors
are one-dimensional. 

The article talks about their methods for using GIS Raster and vectors. The authors mention, "base dataset 
creation involves processing raster topography data with vector country boundary data using a Geographical 
Information System (GIS) and other geospatial software" (Lloyd et al.), which means that both vectors and 
matrices are important for creating base datasets.
