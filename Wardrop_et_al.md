# Top-down vs. Bottom-up

Matt Wydra

The main difference between these two methods of disaggregating data is how they approach general and specific 
data. For bottom-up, the data is analyzed very specifically and becomes more and more general. However,
top-down analyzation looks at the very general and becomes more and more specific. With anything, there will be 
advantages and disadvantages. Top-down, while very very accurate and quite nuanced, is very hard to maintain. The authors 
note that mapping data with constantly changing populations and governments is very difficult. On the other hand,
while bottom-up analyzation is very good at mapping populations based off of uncertain data, mapping the data can
be a dangerous and often politically controversial thing to do even if it's based off of the national census. 
Nonetheless, these new methodologies are quite nuanced and are a way to better map populations. To go off on a 
tangent, I'm learning about how videogames used to be made with only 16 Kilobytes of storage and now games take
up gigabytes of space. So, while these new methodologies may be faster and more efficient, they may take up
a lot more space which is quite negative. Anyway, an example of each is as follows: top-down -- GIS; bottom-up --
Global Linear Regression.
